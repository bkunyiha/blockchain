## 3. Timestamp server → block header chaining (Bitcoin Whitepaper Section 3)

In this context, **chaining** means “hash-linking”: each block(block header) stores a **hash pointer** to the previous header (`prev_hash`). That single field turns a list of blocks into a **blockchain**: an append-only sequence where every new header commits to the history before it.

Why this matters:

- **Tamper-evidence**: if we change any past block header or its committed transaction set, its hash changes, which breaks every later `prev_hash` link.
- **Cumulative cost**: because proof-of-work is applied per header, rewriting history requires redoing the work for the modified block and all descendants.
- **Rust implication**: we treat `prev_hash` as a fixed `[u8; 32]` hash value that must come from the exact canonical header bytes of the previous block.

The paper’s timestamp server takes a hash of items and “each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain”. ([Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))

Intuition: a block header is the “timestamp record” we actually publish and relay. It is small, fixed-size, and it commits to everything that matters:

- it links to history (`prev_hash`)
- it commits to the transaction set (`merkle_root`)
- it commits to the difficulty rule (`difficulty_bits`, also called **nBits**, which compactly encodes the PoW target threshold) and the search value (`nonce`)
- it carries time (`timestamp`)

In Bitcoin, the *block header* is a fixed-size structure: **80 bytes**.

Why **80 bytes** (and why we hash the header):

- The Bitcoin block header has a fixed layout with fixed-size fields. In bytes, it is:
  - `version` (4)
  - `prev_hash` (32)
  - `merkle_root` (32)
  - `timestamp` (4)
  - `difficulty_bits`(nBits) (4)
  - `nonce` (4)
  - Total: \(4 + 32 + 32 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 80\) bytes.
- Mining/proof-of-work needs a value we can hash **over and over** while we vary the nonce. A fixed 80-byte header is ideal: it is small, deterministic, and cheap to re-hash millions/billions of times.
- We don’t need to hash the entire block body every time, because the header already commits to the transaction list via `merkle_root`. If any transaction changes, the Merkle root changes, and therefore the 80-byte header changes.

  A concrete way to think about this: the Merkle root is a **compact fingerprint** of the entire transaction list.

  - Suppose a block contains transactions `tx1`, `tx2`, `tx3`, `tx4`.
  - Each transaction has an identifier (conceptually) `txid_i = sha256d(serialize_tx(tx_i))`.
  - The Merkle tree hashes pairs upward until one root remains:

```
txid1    txid2    txid3    txid4
  \       /         \       /
  H12 = sha256d(txid1 || txid2)   H34 = sha256d(txid3 || txid4)
              \                 /
               merkle_root = sha256d(H12 || H34)
```

  Now imagine *one byte* inside `tx3` changes (even a different signature encoding):
  - `serialize_tx(tx3)` changes → `txid3` changes
  - `H34 = sha256d(txid3 || txid4)` changes
  - `merkle_root = sha256d(H12 || H34)` changes
  - `header.merkle_root` changes → the 80-byte header bytes change → `block_hash = sha256d(header_80_bytes)` changes

  This is why miners hash only the header while searching for a nonce: the header already commits to the full block contents through `merkle_root`.

To encode this in Rust, we serialize those header fields into the canonical 80-byte array and define:
`block_hash = sha256d(serialize_block_header(header_80_bytes))`.

```rust
pub fn serialize_block_header(h: &BlockHeader) -> [u8; 80] {
    let mut b = [0u8; 80];
    let mut off = 0usize; // usize is Rust’s “pointer-sized” unsigned integer type. It’s the standard type for indexing slices/arrays and byte offsets (because it matches the platform’s address size: 64-bit on most modern machines).
    b[off..off + 4].copy_from_slice(&h.version.to_le_bytes()); off += 4;
    b[off..off + 32].copy_from_slice(&h.prev_hash); off += 32;
    b[off..off + 32].copy_from_slice(&h.merkle_root); off += 32;
    b[off..off + 4].copy_from_slice(&h.timestamp.to_le_bytes()); off += 4;
    b[off..off + 4].copy_from_slice(&h.difficulty_bits.to_le_bytes()); off += 4;
    b[off..off + 4].copy_from_slice(&h.nonce.to_le_bytes());
    b
}

pub fn block_hash(h: &BlockHeader) -> [u8; 32] {
    sha256d(&serialize_block_header(h))
}
```

**What this code is doing**

- `serialize_block_header` writes the header fields into the exact 80-byte layout Bitcoin uses.
- `block_hash` computes the block identifier as `sha256d(header_80_bytes)`.

**How it connects**

- `prev_hash` links blocks into the hash chain (“each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash”), matching the timestamp-server idea in the whitepaper. ([Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))
- `merkle_root` commits the transaction list into the header.
- `difficulty_bits` (nBits) determines the PoW **target threshold** used by `meets_target` below.
- `nonce` is the 4-byte value miners vary to get a different `block_hash` while trying to satisfy `block_hash <= target`.

- **Why we need both `difficulty_bits(nBits)`, `target`, and `nonce`**:
  For more on `nBits`, Read bellow explanatio and see: **nBits → target: why exponent is byte-length**.
  - **`difficulty_bits(nBits)` (4 bytes)**: the network’s *rule (constraint)*, stored in the header.
    - It is a **compact encoding** of the PoW threshold; it does **not** equal the full 256-bit target.
    - Nodes enforce that it follows the network’s difficulty adjustment rules for that height (miners can’t pick an easier value and still get accepted).
  - **`target` (256-bit integer)**: the *expanded threshold* we actually compare against.
    - We compute it via `target = bits_to_target(difficulty_bits)`.
    - Validity rule: interpret `block_hash` as a number and require `block_hash <= target`.
  - **`nonce` (4 bytes)**: the miner’s *search knob* (often misspelled “nouce”).
    - Changing `nonce` changes the 80-byte header bytes, which changes `block_hash`.
    - Mining is: keep trying different `nonce` values (and if we exhaust 32-bit nonce space, vary other fields like an extraNonce in the coinbase or the timestamp) until `block_hash <= target`.
  - **Concrete contrived examples** (with values):
    - **Toy model (8-bit hashes, not real Bitcoin)**:
      - Pretend “hashes” are only 8 bits, so they are in `0..=255`.
      - Pretend `difficulty_bits` directly stores the target (this is the simplification).
      - Let `difficulty_bits = 0x0F` → `target = 0x0F` (15 in decimal). Valid hashes are `0..=15` (16/256 ≈ 6.25%).
      - Now vary the miner knob:
        - `nonce = 1` → `hash = 0xA9` (169 in decimal) → invalid because `169 > 15`
        - `nonce = 2` → `hash = 0x03` (3 in decimal) → valid because `3 <= 15`
    - **Bitcoin-style meaning (real shape: compact `nBits` → 256-bit `target`)**:
      - In Bitcoin, `difficulty_bits` is “compact”: it stores an **exponent** and **mantissa** that expand into a big 256-bit threshold.
      - Example (the canonical genesis-style value): `difficulty_bits = nBits = 0x1d00ffff`
        - Why this value (0x1d00ffff or 486,604,799 in decimal)? It is the **genesis / “difficulty 1”** setting on Bitcoin mainnet: it encodes a very large target (i.e. **minimum difficulty / easiest PoW**) so early blocks were feasible to mine on CPU hardware. After genesis, the network adjusts `difficulty_bits` over time via the difficulty adjustment rule to target a roughly constant block rate.
        - exponent = `0x1d` (29 in decimal)
        - mantissa = `0x00ffff` (65,535 in decimal)
          - Bit layout reminder (in the 4-byte `nBits` field): **exponent = 8 bits (1 byte)**, **mantissa = 24 bits (3 bytes)**.
          - There is a small normalization rule in the reference implementation: if the top (sign) bit of the mantissa would be set, the encoding shifts so the mantissa stays within 3 bytes without being interpreted as negative in the historical signed-magnitude-style format.
        - expanded target (conceptually): `target = mantissa * 256^(exponent - 3)`
      - Interpretation:
        - `difficulty_bits(nBits)` is the *compact description* of the threshold we must meet.
        - `target` is the *actual 256-bit threshold* we compare the header hash against.
        - `nonce` is the value we vary to try to find a header hash that lands below that threshold.
        - Note: `difficulty_bits = nBits = 0x1d00ffff` (decimal **486,604,799**) is the value of **`nBits` itself** (the **compact encoding**), not the expanded 256-bit target.
        - Target expansion formula:
          - `target = mantissa × 256^(exponent − 3)`
          - For this example: `target = 0x00ffff × 256^26 = 0x00ffff << 208`
        - Expanded 256-bit target (32-byte big-endian hex):
          - `0x00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

Takeaway: the “chain” is just `prev_hash` pointers + header hashing. Once we can compute header hashes deterministically, we have the backbone that PoW secures.
